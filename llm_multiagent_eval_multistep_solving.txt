The prediction of 75km/h is incorrect as it does not reflect the average speed calculated from the given data.\n3. The correct answer is 50 km/h, which is the average speed calculated by dividing the total distance traveled (150 km + 100 km = 250 km) by the total time taken (5 hours for the first part and 4 hours for the second part).\n\nOverall, the model's prediction is incorrect and needs to improve in its ability to calculate average speed accurately."
