    "agent_feedback": "Score: 3\nExplanation: The model prediction is factually correct that the total cost of buying 3 apples at $2 and 2 bananas at $1 would be $5. However, it lacks completeness as it does not include tax or any other additional costs that might apply in some contexts. Additionally, the language used in the model prediction is not clear enough to convey the same level of clarity as the reference answer, which could lead to confusion for users who are not familiar with the specific pricing structure mentioned in the question. Therefore, a score of 3 out of 5 seems appropriate.",

This implies that the train traveled at a constant speed without any stops or delays, which is unlikely in reality. Therefore, the model's answer could be improved by considering additional factors such as traffic conditions, weather, and other potential disruptions that may affect the train's travel time.",
