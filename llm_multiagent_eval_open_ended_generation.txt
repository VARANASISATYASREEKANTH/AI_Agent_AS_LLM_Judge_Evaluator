The island would have plenty of outdoor activities to explore, such as snorkeling, scuba diving, and hiking through lush rainforests.

However, the reference of relaxing on a beach with books and sunshine was not incorporated in the model's prediction. Therefore, while the prediction provides a valid option, it does not fully match the original question's context."
