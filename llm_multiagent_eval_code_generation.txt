Compare prediction to reference: The predicted function is similar to the reference function, but it uses different variable names (a, b) instead of x, y.\n3. Assess correctness, clarity, completeness: The predicted function is correct in terms of its functionality, but it could be more clear and complete by providing a docstring that explains what the function does and what inputs and outputs it expects/returns. It would also be more descriptive to name the function something like `sum_two_numbers` instead of just `add_numbers`.\n4. Give score from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent): I would give this prediction a score of 3 out of 5 because it is mostly correct, but could be improved with additional clarity and completeness."
